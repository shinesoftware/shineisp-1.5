### ShineISP 2
ShineISP is a **billing system** to **manage your customers** (CMS, eCommerce, CRM, ERP) like WHMCS and WHMAP, Parallels Plesk Billing, AWBS (Advanced Webhosting Billing System) and ClientExec.

The idea for the project was born here at Shine Software headquarters. We found our customer registration process was annoying and complicated because we had to enter the same data 5 times in 5 different systems. Not to mention this process was time-consuming and a potential source of making mistakes. 

So we thought to build us a small and modular system in order to simplify our customers accounting tasks. It turned out to become a project which has been growing day by day ever since we started it, **thanks to the help and support of a (small) community** and the **simple approach to the project**. There are many features to be included into the first alpha release and we are excited to start the "real thing".
